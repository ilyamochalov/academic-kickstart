[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) is a wonderful book for everyone who is looking for ground up explanation about how modern day computer works. 

I personally enjoyed the level of details and deep dive into the history and evolution of all different parts of modern computers.
