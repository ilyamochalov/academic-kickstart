The internet of things has been around for almost a decade, but most people still not sure what it is and what are the most common use cases.
Oxford dictionary defines Internet of Things as:

> The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data.

In this article, I will show what re most common use cases for the Internet of Things and how they create value for system users.

### 1) Advanced Monitoring

Advanced Monitoring or Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is an integrated network of sensors, smart meters and software systems that helps help to monitor utilities such as gas and water pipes, electrical grid, ventilation, etc.

**Value:** higher accuracy of measurements due to the elimination of manual errors, better customer service, reduced equipment maintenance cost. 

### 2) Agricultural drones

Drones are unmanned vehicles. Agricultural monitoring is one of the most mature uses of drones. Drones can:
- monitor plants health,
- plant seeds,
- spread nutrients.

**Values:** lower labor cost, up to 10 times more efficient compared to ground-based observers, saves time, water and nutrients efficiency.

### 3) Asset health management

Asset health management is one of the most mature use cases in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) field. Health management as its names suggests analyzing the health of assets and gives feedback on if an asset needs to be replaced or require maintenance.

**Values:** improved asset efficiency enables a higher return on investments and lower
production cost.

### 4) Building Management 
Building Energy Management System is IT system that help with monitoring building technical services: HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), lightning, water, electricity. 

**Values:** improve overall equipment effectiveness and save money by minimizing equipment failure and optimizing energy usage and performance levels.

### 5) Digital twins
Digital twin as a digital representation of real-world objects or processes. Digital twins help in analyzing monitored object data, identifying problems before they occur, prevent downtime.

**Values:** efficient exploitation
